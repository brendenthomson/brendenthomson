While growing up in a town called Flower Mound just north of Dallas, Texas, I learned to appreciate the world and its biological diversity. I would often enjoy watching and interacting with the many lizards, bugs, birds, and other animals that would come by my home. My father was also an aquarium hobbyist and taught me to appreciate the life and diversity that exists below the surface of the sea. My adoration for the natural world only grew with time. After graduating high school, I attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. There, my understanding of the diversity of life that exists on the Earth and the evolutionary processes that gave rise to that diversity grew and left me in awe. I also came to love a group of organisms that I had previously ignored in my growing up years, plants. I took a course on Plant Diversity and became facinated by their sporic lifecycles, evolutionary journey, and their diverse forms. Bryophytes were one group in particular that caught my attention. These tiny plants demonstrate the alternation of generations that I found so fascinating, and have a wealth of intriguing life strategies, symbioses, and ecological effects despite their small size. I am now in the EEB Department at the Univeristy of Connecticut pursuing a Master's degree studying bryophyte evolution and systematics.
